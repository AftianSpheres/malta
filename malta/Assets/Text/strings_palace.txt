The portal is inert... Embark on adventures, and maybe you'll find a way to activate it?
The portal remains inert, but somehow, it seems as if something about it has changed.
The portal frame glows faintly, and seems hot to the touch.
Space seems somehow altered within the portal frame.
There's a hole in the air within the portal frame, twisting wildly and loosing sparks.
The portal is still, like the surface of a placid lake. You can see into another world...
It's not clear what you'd need to do to activate the portal. Maybe a wizard might have the means to do so, though...?
The Wizard's Tower seems like it's connected to the portal somehow...
The portal seems like it's nearly ready for use. Just a little more!
You have the resources to upgrade the Wizard's Tower.
You'll need to wait for some more resources, though.
You're short on bricks. Try upgrading the Mason.
You're short on metal. Try upgrading the Blacksmith.
You're short on planks. Try upgrading the Sawmill.
The portal is ready. All that remains is to activate it.
It's said that this portal is a gate to another world... but it doesn't seem to be usable right now.
The portal has opened. All you need do now is step through.
