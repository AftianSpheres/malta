The portal is inert... Embark on adventures, and maybe you'll find a way to activate it?
The portal remains inert, but somehow, it seems as if something about it has changed.
The portal frame glows faintly, and seems hot to the touch.
Space seems somehow altered within the portal frame.
There's a hole in the air within the portal frame, twisting wildly and loosing sparks.
The portal is still, like the surface of a placid lake. You can see into another world...
It's not clear what you'd need to do to activate the portal. Maybe a wizard might have the means to do so, though...?
The Wizard's Tower seems like it's connected to the portal somehow...
The portal seems like it's nearly ready for use. Just a little more!
You have the mana to upgrade the Wizard's Tower.
You'll need more mana to upgrade the Wizard's Tower.



The portal is ready. All that remains is to activate it.
It's said that this portal is a gate to another world... but it doesn't seem to be usable right now.
The portal has opened. All you need do now is step through.
Next destination: Forest Outskirts
Scouts say a powerful magic-user has been spotted amongst a gang of bandits. The lot should be manageable enough, but take care.
Next destination: Forest Depths
Scouts say that a band of skilled mercenaries has been hired by the forest folk. Expect greater resistance. You may want to invest in extra training for your party before embarking.
Next destination: Overgrown City
Scouts confirm that they've found the city of the forest folk. This will be an exceptionally dangerous expedition, but we have reason to believe that their city may hide something having to do with the portal...
Next destination: Forest Labyrinth Level 
...We've had no word from our scouts. What's more, it seems like we'll need to offer a wager of our resources to enter... Is this really a good idea?
